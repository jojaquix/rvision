# rvision
### A very basic Rust console library for TUIs. Just for fun and learn.

The idea of this project is learn rust doing something similar 
to turbovision (ObjectPascal and C++ framework to build TUI's).

### Steps
* Basic functions for console manipulation.
* Study TVision clases and see how to map the functionality to Rust.
* TScreen, TView at beginning I guess.
