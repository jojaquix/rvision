# rvision
### A very basic Rust console library for TUIs. Just for fun and learn.

The idea of this project is learn rust doing something similar 
to turbovision (ObjectPascal and C++ framework to build TUI's).

### Intent
* Learn and fun with Rust
* May be in the future: MVC/MVVM and Data Binding, Layout algorithms and use it as frontend for light applications

### Steps
* Basic functions for console manipulation.
* Study TVision clases and see how to map the functionality to Rust.
* TScreen, TView at beginning I guess.
